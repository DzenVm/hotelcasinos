casino: |
  Hidden behind an art-deco arch, the **Grand Casino** still spins an oak-wood roulette wheel rumoured to pre-date the war.  
  Two discreet *casino rooms*—deep-blue velvet, no cameras—host high-stakes poker till dawn, while the main *casino hall* hums with blackjack and soft trumpet jazz.  
  Win or lose, bartender Marek slides over his trademark Żubrówka-tonic “for balance”.

atmosphere: |
  Step inside and the parquet breathes sandalwood. The manually operated lift glides so slowly it feels like a scene from an old Polish film—one floor, one frame at a time.  
  On Sunday mornings a pianist in white linen plays “Nie płacz, kiedy odjadę”, gulls argue outside, and the Baltic slips silver light across the marble.

rooms_suites:
  - Deluxe Sea-View Room – wake up to kayaks bobbing under your balcony
  - Junior Suite Park-Side – pine-scented breeze straight from Tricity’s oldest park
  - Opera Suite – two balconies and acoustics good enough to rehearse an aria
  - Presidential Apartment – private gate to the beach and nobody’s business

dining: |
  **Grand Blue** plates Baltic turbot with horseradish butter and a mischievous splash of chilled Goldwasser.  
  **Le Bar** mixes the *Monciak Negroni*: a classic stirred with a dash of cranberry bitters for local colour.  
  Come summer, the **Pier Bar** pops up in the sand—grilled sea-bass, cold craft lager, and an outdoor screening of cult Polish flick *Rejs* on Friday nights.

wellness_spa: |
  • Sky-lit pool where clouds drift across the ceiling.  
  • Clarins rituals and a mosaic hammam scented with sea lavender.  
  • Dawn slow-yoga on the pier with coach Maciek—tree-pose made trickier by the marine breeze.

location_hits:
  - 100 steps to the iconic *Molo w Sopocie* wooden pier
  - 8-minute stroll to Bohaterów Monte Cassino Street (locals simply say “Monciak”)
  - SKM train to Gdańsk every 30 minutes—exactly long enough for Perfect’s “Autobiografia”

meetings: |
  The original *casino hall*—now the **Baltic Ballroom**—hosts anything from C-suite retreats to bridge tournaments.  
  Most-requested AV trick: “Sea view, please, but no glare on my slides.”

amenities:
  - Private beach loungers with towels the colour of misty sea-foam
  - Underground parking with EV chargers (yes, even for vintage Polish *Syrena* conversions)
  - Vintage **Romet** bikes for rent—complete with wicker basket big enough for a Goldwasser bottle
  - Kids Club: sail-making workshop and amber-bracelet crafting
  - Dogs under 10 kg stay free; larger pups get their own banana-yellow bathrobe

faq:
  - q: "Can non-residents play in the casino halls?"
    a: "Yes; bring ID. After 8 p.m. we swap flip-flops for jackets—smart-casual is the rule."
  - q: "Is the spa included in the room rate?"
    a: "Pool and sauna are complimentary; *Baltic Zen* massages are extra (and worth every zloty)."
  - q: "Do all rooms have balconies?"
    a: "All sea-view categories do; park-side rooms offer Juliet balconies overlooking the pines."

reviews:
  - "Poker till 3 a.m., sunrise yoga at 7—the best kind of jet-lag therapy."
  - "Breakfast with a live pianist and Baltic gulls felt like a Wes Anderson vignette."
  - "VIP casino room so hushed you can hear the chips breathe."
